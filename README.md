# CookieMonsta Discord BOT

* This was my private **Discord BOT** and has been written using [**Discord.JS library**](https://discord.js.org/#/)
* To see what the BOT can do, go here: https://github.com/tutyamxx/CookieMonsta-BOT
* **BOT is OFFLINE**, if you want to run it or host it, make sure you read the files, you might need some **API keys** here and there.
* Max servers that the BOT has been present in: ***167***

* **WARNING! INDENTATION ON GITHUB MIGHT LOOK LIKE A POTATO, IF YOU CLONE THIS REPO AND OPEN IT WITH ANY DECENT TEXT EDITOR, IT WILL BE INDENTED PROPERLY!**

* I won't update it anymore, it is as it is!


## Now, a few things you need first:

* **Linux** or **Mac OS X**
* *If you have Windows, sorry. Might work, but 100% I had trouble running it on Windows.*
* [**Discord**](https://discordapp.com/) installed.


## You need [NPM (Node Package Manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/). After that, install these in the bot folder *(copy and paste one command at a time, in your terminal)*:

```
sudo npm install -g node-gyp
npm i node-gyp better-sqlite3
npm install --save better-sqlite3

npm install node-opus
npm i opusscript

npm install --save discord.js
npm install --save jimp
npm install gm
npm install dblapi.js
npm i needle

npm install get-json
npm install ignore-case
npm install flip-text
npm install moji-translate

sudo npm install long

npm install moment
npm install --save word-wrap
npm install chalk
```

# Tools needed to be installed in order to run the BOT properly:

## For Linux:

```
apt-get install ffmpeg

sudo apt-get install imagemagick libmagickcore-dev libmagickwand-dev libmagic-dev
sudo apt-get install imagemagick
```

## For Mac:
```
brew install graphicsmagick
brew upgrade graphicsmagick
```

## BOT Uses these images gathered by me, in 2 albums. Links are below:

## If you want to run the BOT script forever, install this:

```npm install forever -g```

## Usage:
* ``forever start CookieMonstaBOT.js``
* ``forever stopall``
* ``forever list``
